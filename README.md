# README
The source code of my game named DeceBalus. Might not be up to date

## What is this?
This is a simple game based on Rolling Sky which allows players to edit levels and themes.
The levels and themes are edited by editing JSON files, in order to make editing more similar to RS editing.

## How to download?
You can't download the game yet, because it's still not finished. However, anyone (except Anti-Romanians) can contribute to the game by contributing to this repository.
