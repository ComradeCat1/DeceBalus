# README
The source code of my game named DeceBalus. Might not be up to date

## What is this?
This is a simple game based on Rolling Sky which allows players to edit levels and themes.
The levels and themes are edited by editing JSON files, in order to make editing more similar to RS editing.

## How to download?
You can't download the game yet, because it's still not finished. However, anyone (except Anti-Romanians) can contribute to the game by contributing to this repository.

## How to build an APK for this unfinished game?
1. Clone this repository by running:
 ```git clone https://github.com/ComradeCat1/DeceBalus.git```
2. Download Unity 2021.3.21f1 with Android Build Tools if you haven't
3. Open the cloned repository in Unity 2021.3.21f1
4. Go to Build Settings, and make sure the platform is set to "Android"
5. Click "Build" and choose the file path where you want to save the APK.
6. Wait at least 2-3 minutes
7. And done! You can now send the built APK from your computer to your phone and install it!
